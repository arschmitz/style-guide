Following is a somewhat complete document that outlines both style guides and a general approach to writing Javascript & Ember at Isle of Code.

For brevity, content is split across the following pages:

* [General JS Guidelines](general-and-javascript-style-guides.md);
* [SCM (git) Guidelines] (scm-git-guides.md); and
* [Ember Specific Comments] (ember-style-guides.md).
